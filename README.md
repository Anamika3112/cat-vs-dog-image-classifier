A beginner-friendly deep learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Model will train and show predictions

## Description

In this project, I built a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. I used a pre-organized dataset provided by TensorFlow, which contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. The images were loaded and preprocessed using built-in utilities, and I created a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn from the data. The model was trained for a few epochs and was able to accurately differentiate between the two classes. After training, I tested the model on a few images and displayed the predicted labels along with the actual ones using matplotlib. This project helped me understand how to work with image data, build and train CNNs, and visualize model predictions. I also uploaded the notebook and sample outputs to GitHub, making the project easy to access and reuse.
